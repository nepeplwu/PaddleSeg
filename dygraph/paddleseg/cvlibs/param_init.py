    Initialize the `param` with Normal distribution.

    Args:
        param (Tensor): Tensor that needs to be initialized.

    Examples:

        from paddleseg.cvlibs import param_init
        import paddle.nn as nn

        linear = nn.Linear(2, 4)
        param_init.normal_init(linear.weight, loc=0.0, scale=1.0)

def msra_init(param, **kwargs):
    """
    Initialize the input tensor with MSRA initialization.

    This function implements the `param` initialization from the paper
    `Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on
    ImageNet Classification <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852>`_
    by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun. This is a
    robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier
    nonlinearities. In case of Uniform distribution, the range is [-x, x], where
    .. math::
        x = \sqrt{\\frac{6.0}{fan\_in}}
    In case of Normal distribution, the mean is 0 and the standard deviation
    is
    .. math::
        \sqrt{\\frac{2.0}{fan\_in}}

    Examples:

        from paddleseg.cvlibs import param_init
        import paddle.nn as nn

        linear = nn.Linear(2, 4)
        # uniform is used to decide whether to use uniform or normal distribution
        param_init.msra_init(linear.weight, uniform=False)

    initializer = nn.initializer.MSRA(**kwargs)
    initializer(param, param.block)
